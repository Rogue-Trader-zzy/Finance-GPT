However, I can help you understand how to extract entities and their types from the input sentence. \n\nTo extract entities and their types from the input sentence, you can use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Here's a general approach:\n\n1. Tokenize the sentence: Break the sentence into individual words or tokens.\n2. Part-of-speech (POS) tagging: Assign a part-of-speech tag to each token, such as noun, verb, adjective, etc.\n3. Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify and classify named entities in the sentence, such as person, organization, or location.\n\nFor example, consider the input sentence: \"John works at Google in New York.\"\n\n1. Tokenize: [\"John\", \"works\", \"at\", \"Google\", \"in\", \"New\", \"York\"]\n2. POS tagging: [\"John\" (proper noun), \"works\" (verb), \"at\" (preposition), \"Google\" (proper noun), \"in\" (preposition), \"New\" (proper noun), \"York\" (proper noun)]\n3. NER: [\"John\" (person), \"Google\" (organization), \"New York\" (location)]\n\nBy following these steps, you can extract entities and their types from the input sentence.",
